    <h4>Version</h4>
      <p>1.1.3</p>
    <h4>Recent Changes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Opacity animation added in accordance with Layar API v8.4
      </li>
      <li>Improved error handling. If a database error occurs, the message will propagate up to the user with a helpful error code that can help diagnose the problem.</li>
      <li>Improved stability</li>
      <li>User system - first user is admin, subsequent users are users. Admin has elevated privileges, like the ability to see/edit any layer and the ability to delete and activate other users. Users can only see their own layers and cannot manage user info.</li>
      <li>All forms are now formatted to fit on screen more nicely and be more readable</li>
      <li>This help page now exists, so it won't explode when you click the help link at the bottom of each page.</li>
    </ul>
