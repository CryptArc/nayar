# nayar [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thomasrstorey/nayar.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/thomasrstorey/nayar)

library and API wrapper for Layar webservices providing POI data for geo and vision layers

###Version
  <p>1.1.2</p>
###Recent Changes

* Improved error handling. If a database error occurs, the message will propagate up to the user with a helpful error code that can help diagnose the problem.
* Improved stability
* User system - first user is admin, subsequent users are users. Admin has elevated privileges, like the ability to see/edit any layer and the ability to delete and activate other users. Users can only see their own layers and cannot manage user info.
* All forms are now formatted to fit on screen more nicely and be more readable.
